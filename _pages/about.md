I am an M.S. student in CS at UIUC. I work with my advisor [Prof. Charith Mendis](https://charithmendis.com). My research interests include Machine Learning Compilers, Machine Learning Systems, and Accelerators. I am currently interning at [Amazon AWS, Annapurna Labs](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/amazon-web-services/annapurna-labs).

I have a strong passion for research and development, and I possess practical experience in academic and industrial settings. During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to visit UCLA as a research intern, working with [Prof. Jason Cong](https://vast.cs.ucla.edu/people/faculty/jason-cong) on FPGA accelerator design automation. I once interned at [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/about?lang=en) and [NFTGo](https://nftgo.io).
