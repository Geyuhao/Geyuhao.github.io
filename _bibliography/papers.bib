  title={Optimized GPU code generation framework for Sparse Regular Attention},
  content={Developed SPLAT, an optimized framework for efficient Sparse-MHSA, targeting moderate sparsity levels. Introduced Affine Compressed Sparse-Row (ACSR) format for regular sparsity patterns in MHSA. Engineered advanced GPU code-generation algorithms for ACSR, enhancing sparse-MHSA kernel performance. Achieved 2.05x and 4.05x speedups over Triton and TVM kernels with SPLAT implementation.},

  title={Automated FPGA Accelerator Optimization Aided by Graph Neural Networks and Efficient Design Space Exploration},
  content={Working with <a href= "https://vast.cs.ucla.edu/people/faculty/jason-cong"> Prof. Jason Cong's</a> group, researching Automated FPGA Accelerator Design. Combined GNN with an ML/RL-based Design Space Exploration to achieve FPGA Accelerator Design Automation. Developed a learning-based Cost Model with GNN as a surrogate of the HLS tool for quick and accurate assessment. Optimized DSE by deploying heuristic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing. Used Reinforcement-Learning and Bandits for automatic algorithm selection, boosting exploration speed by 11%},
