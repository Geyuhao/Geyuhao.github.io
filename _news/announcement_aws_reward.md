ðŸš€ I received a Certificate of Appreciation (file:///intern_certificate.pdf) from the [Neuron](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/) team at [Amazon Annapurna Labs](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/amazon-web-services/annapurna-labs) for developing autotuning infrastructure that significantly improved AWS [Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/?nc1=h_ls) performance. This project was recognized as one of the most impactful contributions during my internship.
