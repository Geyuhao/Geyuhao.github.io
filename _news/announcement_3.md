I will join Amazon AWS, specifically the [Annapurna Labs](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/amazon-web-services/annapurna-labs), this summer as a software engineer intern. I will work with the Compiler team on the AWS [Neuron project](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/), which aims to optimize deep learning training and inference on AWS Triton and Inferentia chips.
