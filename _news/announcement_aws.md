:tada: I joined Amazon AWS, [Annapurna Labs](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/amazon-web-services/annapurna-labs), as a software engineer intern. I am working with the Compiler team on the AWS [Neuron](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/), which aims to optimize deep learning training and inference on AWS [Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/?nc1=h_ls) and Inferentia chips.
